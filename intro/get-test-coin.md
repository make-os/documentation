# Get Test Coins

Most transactions on MakeOS require users to pay a small fee to the network to allow for fast processing and block inclusion. On this page, you will learn how to get some test coins on our testnet \(v1.0\).

## Create a key

Registering a new repository requires an identity. On MakeOS, keys offer a way for users to create an identity, authorize transactions, receive/send value and pay for services. You can create a key using the command below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Bash" %}
```bash
kit key create
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Output" %}
```
Passphrase> *****
Repeat Passphrase> *****
✅ Key successfully created!
- Address: os150xvxt559v4n5530tw9y5tk2ghfflsczqxcdja
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You will be asked to provide a passphrase that will be used to encrypt the key and store it in the keystore.
