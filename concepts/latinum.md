# $MAKE

## Overview

Permission-less Proof of Stake blockchain networks like MakeOS requires a native digital currency primarily for providing network security via staking.&#x20;

A native currency is also used to incentivize network participants to provide compute resources that help the network perform its core functions consistently.

On Proof-of-work chains, they contribute to the security of the network by incentivizing network participants to compete to create new blocks which raises the mining difficulty and makes it expensive for attacks to occur frequently or be sustained.

MakeOS introduces a currency known as MAKE.&#x20;

## Supply

MAKE is a deflationary behaviour like Bitcoin. There will only ever be 800,000,000 MAKE. At launch, there will be an initial supply of not more than 400,000,000  allocated to the early team, investors, ecosystem and the community.&#x20;

## Use Case

* For paying network fees.
* For providing network security via staking and delegating.
* For incentivizing network participants.
* For network and repository governance.

## Distribution

* 15% - Founders
* 10% - Core Contributors and Non-founding team.
* 20% - Strategic Partners.
* 15% - Ecosystem.
* 38.7% - Public Distribution.
* 1.3% - Ellcrys Contributors.
  * Note: Since MakeOS is the successor of the defunct Ellcrys project, 19,000,000 ELL distributed to Ellcrys investors & bounties participants will be reallocated proportionally to the initial supply of the MakeOS platform. Given that MakeOS initial supply is 90% less than the Ellcrys supply, a total of 1,900,000 MAKE will be allocated to Ellcrys investors, bounty and airdrop participants.&#x20;
