# Roadmap

## Phase 0 - Collaboration

This is the genesis phase of the MakeOS blockchain. In this phase, the goal is to release a code collaboration system for hosting and sharing code conveniently and without relying on a centralized authority. Allowing developers access to a decentralized alternative to GitHub is the mission.&#x20;

### Deliverables

* DevNet 1 Launch (<mark style="color:green;">released v1-alpha</mark>).
* Code Sharing and Hosting Protocol (<mark style="color:green;">released v0.0.32-alpha</mark>).&#x20;
* Code Collaboration Hub (embedded in client) (<mark style="color:green;">released v1-alpha</mark>).
* Initial DEX Offering.
* Uniswap Launch.&#x20;
* GitSpace (GitHub alternative).
* Block Explorer.
* Wallet (Desktop).
* Wallet (Browser Extension).
* Open Source Sustenance Protocol.
* Dilithium/Latinum -> $MAKE Swap.
* Devnet 2 Launch.
* Protocol Audit.&#x20;
* Game of Remotes Launch (Incentivized Testnet).
* $MAKE -> Mainnet Swap.
* Mainnet Launch.

## Phase 1 - Execution

This phase begins after the mainnet launch of the MakeOS protocol. As a protocol that wants developers to have access to a decentralized collaboration engine, MakeOS also want to be a protocol for executing or running software.

### Deliverables

* Avalanche Consensus.&#x20;
* Virtual Machine Engine - An extendable layer for deploying virtual machines for any language. The initial release will support virtual machines for:
  * Solidity (EVM).
  * TypeScript (NodeVM).
  * Go (GoVM).
  * Java (JavaVM).&#x20;
* System DAOs: System DAOs are protocol-incentivized, staked groups of oracles providing features that cannot be easily accomplished by only the protocol. SystemDAO usage fees will be paid in MAKE. Since this system will execute non-deterministic operations, it will rely on open governance, availability challenges and a dispute system to be successful.&#x20;
  * **FunctionDAO** - A DAO built on top of MakeOS with the purpose of providing a function-as-a-service (FaaS) system that will allow developers host their backend code.&#x20;
  * **StorageDAO** - A storage DAO designed to provide storage service to developers with active functions running on the FunctionDAO. FuntionDAO apps will be able to persist state to the StorageDAO for a fee.&#x20;
  * **StaticDAO** - A DAO for deploying static websites from repositories stored on MakeOS DHT.&#x20;
  * **DisputeDAO** - A DAO designed to resolve disputes between system DAOs. When there is a disagreement that cannot be automatically resolved by the protocol, the DisputeDAO will be the place to go for open, transparent, community-driven dispute resolution.&#x20;
